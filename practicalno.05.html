    <h1 align="center">Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar</h1>
    <p>Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar (15 October 1542[a] – 27 October 1605),popularly
         known as Akbar the Great (Persian pronunciation: [akbarɪ azam]) and also as Akbar I (Persian
         pronunciation: [akbar]), was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. Akbar
         succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand
         and consolidate Mughal domains in India.</p>
         <p>
            A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to
            include much of the Indian subcontinent. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire
subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal
             state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted
              a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and
              order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support
            of his non-Muslim subjects.Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite
             far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an Indo-Persian culture, to
             himself as an emperor.
